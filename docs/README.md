## üí§ Name Explanation

Imagine that a 3D cube is multiplied by itself two times ‚Äî That's it!

## üíé Core Features

- **Animation engine**: Flexible and well-organized animations handling. You don't need to explicitly manipulate time for each animation, as it is controlled behind the scene.

- **Video exports**: Export any scene to video files.

- **2D and 3D rendering**: Cubecubed produces high-performance animations with eye-soothing graphical effects. At its core, the library utilizes the powerful SVG manipulation abilities of [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3), along with the marvelous 3D graphical system of [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) to create a visual representation of math concepts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Setup

Getting started with Cubecubed is easily easy, you can run this command to initialiize a workspace.

```sh
# `ccw` stands for `create cubecubed workspace`
$ npx ccw my-workspace
```

### Develop

Now you will see the animations in action!

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

See this [Quick Start](https://imaphatduc.github.io/cubecubed/#/quickstart) page for detailed information.

## üóíÔ∏è Notes

### Cubecubed is made for everyone!

Whether you are students, teachers, researchers, or someone who is curious about mathematics, you can use Cubecubed or any visualization tools out there to go on exploring the mystical beauty of the science.

### Inspiration

Cubecubed exists for a reason. Check out this [article](https://dev.to/imaphatduc/my-story-with-cubecubed-2da2) to figure it out.

The project is deeply inspired by [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) - _an animation engine for explanatory math videos_. However, it is not a port or a re-implementation of the engine. Since its first commit on December 1, 2021, Cubecubed has been thriving with upcoming features and friendly community.

### GUI version of Cubecubed

[Cubedbook](https://github.com/imaphatduc/cubedbook) is built on top of Cubecubed to provide a user-friendly GUI environment. If you're not comfortable with programming, Cubedbook is an option for you.

### Footnote

Cubecubed believes the best way to learn and discover math is through the combining process of visualizations and deductive reasoning. If we write math on paper, why don't we write it on a computer?
